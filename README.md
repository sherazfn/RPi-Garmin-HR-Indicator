# RPi-Garmin-HR-Indicator


This program is to take Heart Rate Broadcast information from a Garmin Watch and display that on a LED strip as a color representing the HR zone. 

It's also a small side project to learn more coding. Feel free to suggest better changes and cleaned up code. It'll help me learn more including working with PRs from others.

I'm also trying to use GitHub projects too. Let's see how that goes
