# RPi-Garmin-HR-Indicator


This program is to take Heart Rate Broadcast information from a Garmin Watch and display that on a LED strip as a color representing the HR zone. 

It's also a small side project to learn more coding. Feel free to suggest better changes and cleaned up code. It'll help me learn more including working with PRs from others.
